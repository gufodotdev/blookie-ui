# Blookie UI

**Blookie ui** is a Tailwind CSS plugin that provides styled components designed to work seamlessly with [Radix UI primitives](https://www.radix-ui.com/primitives).

## ðŸš€ Features

- Pre-designed components like buttons, dropdowns, cards, dialogs and more.
- Easy integration with your existing Tailwind CSS setup.
- Customizable with Tailwind's utility-first approach.

## ðŸ“˜ Note on Radix Integration

Blookie was originally designed as a style layer for [Radix UI primitives](https://www.radix-ui.com/primitives), making it an excellent choice for React projects. Radix handles functionality and accessibility, while Blookie provides the styling to create a polished and professional UI.

Since Blookie is just CSS, itâ€™s not tied exclusively to React or Radix. You can use it with other frameworks that have a compatible Radix port, such as Vue, Angular, or Svelte. It can even be used without a framework, purely as a CSS layer for your project.

In addition to its Radix-focused components (like dialogs, accordions, and dropdowns), Blookie also offers many static, non-interactive components such as cards, containers, and buttons that are not tied to Radix. This makes it versatile enough to fit a wide range of use cases, whether or not youâ€™re using React and Radix.
